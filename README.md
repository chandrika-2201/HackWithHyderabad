CFO Helper is a full-stack web application that lets founders, event organisers, and small businesses **simulate “what-if” budget scenarios** and instantly see the effect on **burn rate, runway, and profit**.  
Users can **log in**, adjust **sliders and inputs**, **save scenarios**, and **download a PDF report** containing live charts and key metrics.
